				<p class="about-info1">
					I currently live in the UK, London, and work as a door supervisor, or in
					other words a security guard. My current role entails a high amount of
					customer service, attention to detail and teamwork. I have been coding for
					a couple of months now and I have also completed a 12 week long software
					development bootcamp, which had a heavy emphasis on front end developement.
					I am a driven and creative problem solver, who thrives on the handling of
					software, via the use of code. My journey which began with a practical
					tutorial of Javascipt, and has continued into learning three front end
					languages and also back-end data languages so far, which I have used to
					create a few projects. At present time I am looking for a full time
					position which could kickstart my career and allow me deep dive into the
					role of a developer and work within a team to deliver high quality
					projects.
